# Whim
A screen saver that switches screen savers for macOS.  

## System requirements
macOS Mojave 10.14 or later  

## Installation
Download the notarized disk image [Whim_1.0.0.dmg](https://github.com/SolidUsagi/Whim/releases/latest/download/Whim_1.0.0.dmg).  
After downloading it, double-click to mount it and double-click the `Whim.saver` included inside to install it.  
Once installed, the "Screen Saver" panel in System Preferences will open, so select "Whim" from the list.  

## Usage
Click the "Screen Saver Options" in the "Screen Saver" panel in System Preferences (Apple menu > "System Preferences" > "Desktop & Screen Saver" > "Screen Saver") to open the settings panel and select the screen saver you want to switch from the list and check it. The checked screen savers will switch in a random order.  
The cycle at which the screen saver switches can be set in the "Switch" popup menu. If you select "only at startup", it will not switch during operation. "at a whim" has a random switching time.  

## Limitations
Of the built-in screen savers, slide show screen savers such as "Floating" and "Flip-up" are excluded because I don't know how to make them work from the program.  
In addition, "Word of the Day" is excluded because it will eat up the memory and stop working if it is changed many times.  
I think there are many other screen savers that don't work properly. In some cases, this may cause a system crash. Please use at your own risk.
